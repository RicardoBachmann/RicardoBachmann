# Ricardo Bachmann
Multidisciplinary Artist and Designer working in the fields of: Visual investigations + Critical Cartography + Osint-Research


*Web Development & Coding enthusiast* 

Currently, I am focusing on the medium of cartography as a critical questioning of spatial relationships to each other, as well as visualizing socio-political issues in non-linear narratives through the use of multimedia elements.
